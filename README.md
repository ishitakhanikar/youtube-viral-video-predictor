# youtube-viral-video-predictor
The goal of this project is to analyze what makes a YouTube video go viral, based on video metadata, and to build a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of virality before uploading
This project not only provides analytical insights into YouTube trending patterns, but also integrates a live prediction prompt where users can enter video details (like title length, tag count, posting time, etc.) and get a Yes/No prediction along with a viral probability score.
